# apparmor-docs

The following files are PDF versions of the odt files in 
[lp:~apparmor-dev/apparmor/master/files/head:/documentation/](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~apparmor-dev/apparmor/master/files/head:/documentation/).

This way you can read and search in a browser.

The [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) in this repo checks out the bazaar branch and converts them so
they are always up to date.

To build the Dockerfile and copy the pdf's generated, just run:

```
$ make
```
